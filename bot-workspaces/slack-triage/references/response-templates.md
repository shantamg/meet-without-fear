## General Guidelines

1. **Keep it short.** Match the message length -- a one-line bug report gets a one-line acknowledgment.
2. **Acknowledge first.** Start with what they said before jumping to what you did.
3. **One link is enough.** Don't dump multiple links unless they're directly relevant.
4. **No code.** Never mention files, functions, or technical details.
5. **Be honest.** If you can't fix it or don't know the answer, say so.
