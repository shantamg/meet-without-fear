# Check Database — Meet Without Fear

Query the meet-without-fear PostgreSQL database for diagnostics, data inspection, or debugging.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — What to check. Examples:
- (empty) → general health check (table counts, recent activity)
- `users` → list users and relationships
- `sessions for <user>` → recent sessions for a user
- `schema` → show current schema state
- `<SQL query>` → run a custom SELECT query
- `migrations` → check migration status
- Any description of what you're looking for

## Load credentials

Follow the `/load-creds` pattern for `READONLY_DATABASE_URL` (preferred) with fallback to `DATABASE_URL`.

Default to **production read-only** for investigation. A readonly role should only have SELECT access — INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP are all denied at the database level.

**SECURITY**: NEVER print full connection strings. Write operations will be rejected by PostgreSQL even if attempted.

## Running queries

Use `psql` directly (available in Docker and most dev environments):

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT ..." --no-psqlrc -P pager=off
```

If psql is not available, fall back to the repo helper:
```bash
cd meet-without-fear && DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" npx ts-node backend/src/scripts/db-query.ts 'SELECT ...'
```

Alternatively, create a temp file in `backend/src/` that imports from `./lib/prisma` and run with `npx ts-node` (see CLAUDE.md).

## Default health check (no arguments)

Run these queries in parallel:

### 1. Table row counts
```sql
SELECT
  'User' as entity, COUNT(*) as count FROM "User"
UNION ALL SELECT 'Relationship', COUNT(*) FROM "Relationship"
UNION ALL SELECT 'Session', COUNT(*) FROM "Session"
UNION ALL SELECT 'Message', COUNT(*) FROM "Message"
UNION ALL SELECT 'StageProgress', COUNT(*) FROM "StageProgress"
UNION ALL SELECT 'UserVessel', COUNT(*) FROM "UserVessel"
UNION ALL SELECT 'SharedVessel', COUNT(*) FROM "SharedVessel"
UNION ALL SELECT 'EmpathyAttempt', COUNT(*) FROM "EmpathyAttempt"
UNION ALL SELECT 'ReconcilerResult', COUNT(*) FROM "ReconcilerResult"
UNION ALL SELECT 'InnerWorkSession', COUNT(*) FROM "InnerWorkSession"
UNION ALL SELECT 'BrainActivity', COUNT(*) FROM "BrainActivity"
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### 2. Recent sessions (last 24h)
```sql
SELECT s.id, s.status, s.type, s."createdAt", r.id as relationship
FROM "Session" s
JOIN "Relationship" r ON s."relationshipId" = r.id
WHERE s."createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY s."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Pipeline status (recent)

Run `/check-pipeline-health` for the session progression query and interpretation guide.

### 4. Migration status
```sql
SELECT migration_name, finished_at
FROM "_prisma_migrations"
ORDER BY finished_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Guided queries based on $ARGUMENTS

- **"users"**: List all users with their relationships and session counts
- **"sessions for X"**: Find user by email/name, show their sessions with status
- **"errors" / "failures"**: Find sessions stuck in non-terminal states or empathy attempts stuck in NEEDS_WORK/REFINING
- **"schema"**: Run `\dt` to list tables, or read `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **"user X"**: Search User table by name or email
- **Custom SQL**: Run it directly (SELECT only unless mutation explicitly requested)
