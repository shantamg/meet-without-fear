# Implementation Structure Design

Date: 2025-12-26

## Overview

This document captures the design decisions for transitioning from planning to building the BeHeard app. It establishes development practices, implementation plan structure, and parallel execution strategy using Claude Flow.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Development Practices (CLAUDE.md)

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implementation
- **Shared types**: All DTOs and contracts live in `shared/`
- **Small, testable functions**: Each function does one thing
- **Logic separate from views**: Mobile uses hooks/services for logic, components for UI
- **Verification before completion**: Run `npm run check` and `npm run test`
- **Git workflow**: Commit and push often, small focused commits

### 2. Implementation Plans Location

**Decision**: `implementation/` at repo root

Structure:
```
implementation/
  README.md                    # How to use plans + Claude Flow instructions
  shared/
    index.md                   # Dependencies and order
    session-types.md
    api-contracts.md
    ...
  backend/
    index.md
    auth.md
    database.md
    stage-0-api.md
    ...
  mobile/
    index.md
    auth-flow.md
    navigation.md
    stage-0-ui.md
    ...
```

### 3. Plan File Format

Implementation plans **reference** existing planning docs (source of truth) rather than duplicating content.

Template:
```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Source Documentation
- Links to relevant docs/mvp-planning/plans/ files

## Prerequisites
- [ ] What must be complete before starting

## External Services Required
> **User action needed:** Setup instructions here

## Implementation Steps
1. Test-first steps referencing the planning docs

## Verification
- [ ] `npm run test` passes
- [ ] `npm run check` passes
- [ ] Manual verification steps
```

### 4. Claude Flow Orchestration

**Decision**: Let Claude Flow auto-detect dependencies and parallelize

- Structure plans with clear dependencies in `index.md` files
- Use `--optimize-parallelism` flag for automatic parallel execution
- No complex yaml configuration needed
- Claude Flow reads prerequisites from plan files and builds dependency graph
