# AI Therapy App: Feedback & Bug Report

Based on the feedback session, the following issues have been identified regarding the AI's tone, context memory, UI/UX, and message handling.

## 1. AI Tone & Persona

**Issue:** The AI's default language is too technical and relies too heavily on "Non-Violent Communication" (NVC) jargon.

- **Feedback:** The tone feels "overwhelming" and "clinical." It currently speaks as if the user needs a graduate degree to understand it.
- **Requirement:** The AI must speak in **plain English** without watering down the psychological concepts.
  - It should only shift to technical language if the user explicitly adopts that style first.
  - **Fix:** Update the system prompt to enforce simple language and simple words where possible, while maintaining depth.

## 2. Context & Memory (Critical)

**Issue:** The AI is unaware of messages that have already been sent to the other party.

- **Feedback:** The AI gave advice that was inappropriate because it didn't know what the user had actually shared. (e.g., The AI told the user to say "I'm insecure" to a partner who had just sent a mean message, which made no sense contextually).
- **Fix:**
  - The conversation context **must** include a history of all shared messages.
  - Add a specific section in the prompt: _"These are things that have been shared."_

## 3. "Suggested Share" Guardrails

**Issue:** The AI suggested an aggressive/abrasive opening line.

- **Example:** The AI suggested a message starting with **"Look, Daryl..."**
- **Feedback:** This is accusational and contradicts the therapeutic goal. It happened specifically during the drafting phase (post-reconciler).
- **Fix:** Audit the specific prompt that crafts the "Suggested Share." Ensure it has the same guardrails as the normal stage prompts (focused on non-violent, non-accusational, information-sharing only).

## 4. UI/UX & Application State

**Issue A: "Next Step" Visibility**

- **Description:** When the AI wanted to move to a next step, the option to click was hidden/unclear at the bottom of the screen. The user didn't realize an action was required.

**Issue B: Stuck State (Requires Relog)**

- **Description:** At the end of certain stages, the app failed to auto-advance to the next stage.
- **Workaround:** The user had to log out and log back in to force the UI to catch up with the backend state.
- **Context:** This occurred specifically when the "Reconciler" had content ready to prompt the user.

**Issue C: Message Re-animation**

- **Description:** The app animates _all_ past AI messages one by one upon loading.
- **Fix:** The system needs to recognize past sessions as "read" and static, rather than re-streaming them.

## 5. Input/Output Logic Errors

**Issue:** The AI sent the wrong text string.

- **Description:** When the user agreed to send a suggested message, the AI instead sent a meta-phrase: _"There's something about my experience that might help you understand better."_
- **Diagnosis:** The system is confusing the _process thought_ or the _introduction_ with the _actual content_ to be shared.
- **Fix:** Audit prompts to ensure clear separation between internal thought processes and the final output string intended for the user.
