# Gold Flow Mockups

Status: planning draft
Related: #282, #247, #212, #244
Purpose: low-fidelity interaction mockups for the Stage 3, Stage 4, and Tending redesigns. These are not visual polish specs. They define what appears in chat, what appears as a formatted card, and where user action remains conversational.

## Design Principle

The redesigned flow is conversation-led. UI cards should clarify and preserve state, not replace the dialogue with forms.

- Users answer, select, remove, and revise through text.
- Cards summarize what the AI has heard and what the system is holding.
- Buttons are acceptable for clear consent or navigation gates, but not for replacing the core reflective work.
- The mobile UI should feel like a guided conversation with structured receipts.

## Stage 3 Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Stage 3 starts: What Matters"] --> B["Conversation: user articulates needs"]
  B --> C["Needs Summary Card"]
  C --> D{"User confirms needs?"}
  D -- "No, revise" --> B
  D -- "Yes" --> E["Consent to share"]
  E --> F{"Both users consented?"}
  F -- "No" --> G["Waiting / safety conversation"]
  F -- "Yes" --> H["Side-by-side Needs Reveal Card"]
  H --> I["AI asks: What do you notice?"]
  I --> J["Emotional processing / optional break"]
  J --> K["Validity question"]
  K --> L{"Both validate both lists?"}
  L -- "No" --> M["Explore what feels difficult"]
  M --> K
  L -- "Yes" --> N["Advance to Stage 4"]
```

## Stage 3 Chat Layout

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Phone["Phone Screen"]
    Header["Header: What Matters"]
    Chat["Chat transcript"]
    Card["Inline formatted card"]
    Input["Message input"]
  end

  Header --> Chat --> Card --> Input
```

### Needs Summary Card

Appears when the AI believes the user has articulated enough to confirm.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Card["Needs Summary Card"]
  Title["What I hear matters to you"]
  Need1["Need: To feel respected in front of the kids"]
  Evidence1["In your words: I do not want them seeing me dismissed"]
  Need2["Need: To have reliability around pickup"]
  Evidence2["In your words: I need to know plans will be followed"]
  Prompt["Does this feel right, or should we adjust it?"]

  Card --> Title
  Title --> Need1 --> Evidence1
  Title --> Need2 --> Evidence2
  Card --> Prompt
```

Interaction:

- User confirms in chat: "Yes, that feels right."
- User revises in chat: "The second one is more about trust than pickup."
- System updates the summary card after revision.

Open design detail:

- Decide whether the card is rendered from a structured message type or from tagged content in an AI message.

### Consent Moment

Consent can use a small explicit affordance because it is a gate, but the copy should stay in the conversation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  AI["AI: Are you willing to share this needs summary with partner?"]
  Yes["Button: Share"]
  No["Button: Not yet"]
  Text["User can also answer in text"]

  AI --> Yes
  AI --> No
  AI --> Text
```

### Side-by-side Needs Reveal Card

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Reveal["Needs Reveal Card"]
  Left["You"]
  Right["Partner"]
  YourNeed1["To feel respected"]
  YourNeed2["To trust plans"]
  PartnerNeed1["To not feel controlled"]
  PartnerNeed2["To feel believed"]
  Notice["AI below card: What do you notice?"]

  Reveal --> Left
  Reveal --> Right
  Left --> YourNeed1
  Left --> YourNeed2
  Right --> PartnerNeed1
  Right --> PartnerNeed2
  Reveal --> Notice
```

Rules:

- No overlap badges.
- No "shared need" highlighting.
- No AI-authored common-ground summary.
- Both columns use neutral styling.

### Break / Processing State

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Processing
  Processing --> Continue: user keeps talking
  Processing --> BreakOffered: high intensity or user requests pause
  BreakOffered --> Paused: user takes break
  Paused --> Processing: user returns
  Processing --> ValidityGate: user seems ready
```

UI implication:

- A "Take a break" action can exist as a subtle option.
- The primary flow should still work by text: "I need a minute."

## Stage 4 Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Stage 4 starts"] --> B["AI orients to needs from Stage 3"]
  B --> C["Conversation: user develops proposals"]
  C --> D["Proposal Inventory Card"]
  D --> E["Needs Coverage Audit"]
  E --> F["User revises / removes / adds proposals"]
  F --> D
  E --> G["Selection through conversation"]
  G --> H{"Any shared agreement overlap?"}
  H -- "Yes" --> I["Shared agreements + individual commitments"]
  H -- "No" --> J["No-shared-agreement close"]
  I --> K["Strategy-timed Tending"]
  J --> L["Passive Tending remains open"]
```

## Stage 4 Proposal Inventory Card

The proposal inventory is a formatted receipt of the conversation. It should not be a form-first interaction.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Card["Proposal Inventory Card"]
  Shared["Shared proposals"]
  Individual["Individual commitments"]
  Unaddressed["Needs not yet addressed"]

  S1["Try a Sunday planning conversation for 20 minutes"]
  S1Need["Addresses: Shantam's need for reliability; Darryl's need for clarity"]
  I1["Darryl: journal before responding when flooded"]
  I1Need["Addresses: Darryl's need for steadiness"]
  U1["Shantam: need to feel fully met in hard conversations"]
  U1Note["No shared proposal currently addresses this"]

  Card --> Shared --> S1 --> S1Need
  Card --> Individual --> I1 --> I1Need
  Card --> Unaddressed --> U1 --> U1Note
```

Interaction:

- Add: "I want to add one about bedtime."
- Remove: "The kids conversation comes off the list."
- Select: "I am willing to try the Sunday planning one, but not the daily check-in."
- Preserve boundaries without arguing.

### Needs Coverage Audit Card

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Audit["Needs Coverage Audit"]
  Covered["Covered needs"]
  Partial["Partially covered needs"]
  Open["Unaddressed needs"]

  Covered --> C1["Reliability: Sunday planning proposal"]
  Partial --> P1["Respect: addressed by tone agreement, but not repair after incidents"]
  Open --> O1["To be fully met: no proposal currently on table"]
```

Tone:

- Name gaps honestly.
- Do not imply the gap is a failure.
- Ask whether the user wants to keep exploring or leave the gap named.

### Shared Agreement Outcome

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Both users make selections"] --> B["Overlap Reveal Card"]
  B --> C["Shared agreement card"]
  C --> D["Individual commitments card"]
  D --> E["Check-in timing derived from agreements"]
  E --> F["Session closes into Tending"]
```

### No-shared-agreement Outcome

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Both users make selections"] --> B["No shared overlap"]
  B --> C["Individual commitments persist"]
  C --> D["Unmet needs named"]
  D --> E["Boundary respected"]
  E --> F["No scheduled shared check-in"]
  F --> G["Passive Tending remains open"]
```

Mockup requirements:

- Show this as a legitimate close state, not an error.
- Avoid copy like "failed to agree."
- Make individual commitments and unmet needs visible enough that the work still feels meaningful.

## Tending Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Session closes"] --> B{"Shared agreement with timing?"}
  B -- "Yes" --> C["Schedule strategy-timed check-in"]
  B -- "No" --> D["No scheduled check-in"]
  C --> E["Check-in notification / entry"]
  D --> F["User-initiated re-entry available"]
  E --> G["Per-proposal review"]
  G --> H["Both check-ins complete?"]
  H -- "Yes" --> I["Overlap reveal: where users independently landed"]
  H -- "No" --> J["Proceed with present user after timeout / user choice"]
  F --> K["Brief re-entry conversation"]
  K --> L["Choose path: continue, close, new process, other track"]
```

## Tending Re-entry Surface

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Surface["Tending Entry"]
  Context["Context: what this session was about"]
  Agreements["Shared agreements, if any"]
  Commitments["Individual commitments"]
  OpenNeeds["Needs still open"]
  CTA["Start a check conversation"]

  Surface --> Context
  Surface --> Agreements
  Surface --> Commitments
  Surface --> OpenNeeds
  Surface --> CTA
```

Design questions:

- Is Tending entered from the session detail screen, a notification, or both?
- Does no-agreement Tending show a different header than agreement-based Tending?
- How much of the original session transcript should be visible vs summarized?

## Low-Fidelity Screen States

These sketches show mobile chat-first states. Cards are inline receipts inside the transcript, not standalone forms.

### 1. Stage 3 Needs Summary Card In Chat

State: the user has talked through what matters and the AI is ready to check whether it heard the needs accurately.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| What Matters                  ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| AI                                 |
| I want to pause and reflect back   |
| what I think matters most here.    |
|                                    |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|   | What I hear matters to you |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | 1. To feel respected       |   |
|   |    "I do not want to feel  |   |
|   |    dismissed in front of   |   |
|   |    the kids."             |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | 2. To trust plans will     |   |
|   |    hold                    |   |
|   |    "Pickup changing last   |   |
|   |    minute makes me feel    |   |
|   |    like I cannot count on  |   |
|   |    anything."             |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Still uncertain            |   |
|   | - Is this respect,         |   |
|   |   reliability, or both?    |   |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| Does this feel right, or should we |
| adjust part of it?                 |
|                                    |
| You                                |
| The second one is more about trust.|
|                                    |
| [Message...]                  Send |
+------------------------------------+
```

Behavior notes:

- User revision happens in chat, not by tapping edit rows.
- The refreshed card replaces or follows the previous receipt with a short "Updated" label.
- If the user says "yes," the next AI message asks for consent to share.

### 2. Stage 3 Side-By-Side Reveal Card

State: both users have confirmed their needs summaries and consented to reveal them.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| What Matters                  ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| AI                                 |
| Both of you said these summaries   |
| are ready to share. Here they are  |
| side by side.                      |
|                                    |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|   | Needs on the table         |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | You          Partner       |   |
|   | -----------  ------------  |   |
|   | To feel      To not feel   |   |
|   | respected    controlled    |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | To trust     To feel       |   |
|   | plans will   believed when |   |
|   | hold         explaining    |   |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| Before we try to solve anything,   |
| what do you notice as you read     |
| both lists?                        |
|                                    |
| [Message...]                  Send |
+------------------------------------+
```

Rules:

- The card does not call anything "shared" yet.
- The AI asks for noticing, not agreement.
- If one user reacts strongly, the chat remains in processing before validation.

### 3. Stage 3 Validation / Not-Valid-Yet Continuation

State: the reveal has happened, but one user cannot yet validate the other person's needs.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| What Matters                  ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| You                                |
| I can see why they wrote it, but I |
| cannot say it feels valid yet.     |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| That is okay. We do not need to    |
| force validation. Let's stay with  |
| what makes it hard to acknowledge. |
|                                    |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|   | Validation status          |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Your needs                 |   |
|   | - Heard by partner         |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Partner's needs            |   |
|   | - Not valid yet            |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Current work               |   |
|   | - Understand what gets in  |   |
|   |   the way before moving to |   |
|   |   proposals                |   |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| When you read "to not feel         |
| controlled," what feels untrue,    |
| unfair, or hard to make room for?  |
|                                    |
| [Message...]                  Send |
+------------------------------------+
```

Continuation paths:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["User says not valid yet"] --> B["AI normalizes and slows down"]
  B --> C["Status card names current validation state"]
  C --> D["AI asks what feels hard to make room for"]
  D --> E{"User softens or clarifies?"}
  E -- "Yes" --> F["Ask validation question again in plain language"]
  E -- "No" --> G["Continue exploring without advancing"]
  G --> D
  F --> H{"Both validate both lists?"}
  H -- "Yes" --> I["Advance to Stage 4"]
  H -- "No" --> G
```

### 4. Stage 4 Proposal Inventory Card

State: the user has named several possible strategies and the AI has organized them into a receipt.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| Agreements                    ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| AI                                 |
| Here is what is currently on the   |
| table. You can add, remove, or     |
| revise any of this in your words.  |
|                                    |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|   | Proposal inventory         |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Shared proposals           |   |
|   | 1. Sunday planning for     |   |
|   |    20 minutes              |   |
|   |    Covers: reliability,    |   |
|   |    clarity                 |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | 2. Text before changing    |   |
|   |    pickup                  |   |
|   |    Covers: trust in plans  |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Individual commitments     |   |
|   | - You: say "I need a       |   |
|   |   pause" before leaving    |   |
|   | - Partner: write down      |   |
|   |   schedule changes first   |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Not addressed yet          |   |
|   | - Repair after dismissive  |   |
|   |   comments                 |   |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| What would you like to keep,       |
| change, or take off the table?     |
|                                    |
| [Message...]                  Send |
+------------------------------------+
```

Example chat edits:

- "Keep Sunday planning, remove the pickup text one."
- "Add that if one of us is late we send a new ETA."
- "I can commit to naming when I need a pause, but I do not want it framed as leaving."

### 5. Stage 4 Needs Coverage Audit Card

State: there are proposals on the table, but the AI checks whether the validated needs from Stage 3 are actually covered.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| Agreements                    ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| AI                                 |
| I want to check the proposals      |
| against the needs you both named.  |
|                                    |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|   | Needs coverage audit       |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Covered                    |   |
|   | - Reliability              |   |
|   |   Sunday planning          |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Partly covered             |   |
|   | - Feeling respected        |   |
|   |   Tone agreement helps,    |   |
|   |   but repair after         |   |
|   |   incidents is unnamed     |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Still open                 |   |
|   | - Feeling believed         |   |
|   |   No current proposal      |   |
|   |   directly addresses this  |   |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| Do you want to keep looking for a  |
| proposal around feeling believed,  |
| or leave that gap named for now?   |
|                                    |
| [Message...]                  Send |
+------------------------------------+
```

Behavior notes:

- The audit can appear more than once as proposals change.
- The card must not imply every need has to be solved in one session.
- "Leave it named" is a valid conversational answer.

### 6. Stage 4 Shared-Agreement Outcome

State: both users independently selected at least one shared proposal they are willing to try.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| Agreements                    ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| AI                                 |
| You both independently selected    |
| one proposal you are willing to    |
| try.                               |
|                                    |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|   | Shared agreement           |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Try for the next week      |   |
|   | - Sunday planning for      |   |
|   |   20 minutes               |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Why it is here             |   |
|   | - Supports reliability     |   |
|   | - Supports clarity         |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Individual commitments     |   |
|   | - You: name when you need  |   |
|   |   a pause before leaving   |   |
|   | - Partner: bring schedule  |   |
|   |   changes with a concrete  |   |
|   |   ask                      |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Check-in                   |   |
|   | - After the next Sunday    |   |
|   |   planning conversation    |   |
|   +----------------------------+   |
|                                    |
| AI                                 |
| I will bring this back after the   |
| next planned conversation so each  |
| of you can say how it went.        |
|                                    |
| [Close for now]                    |
+------------------------------------+
```

Closing behavior:

- The shared card is the main receipt.
- Individual commitments stay visible, but do not get described as shared agreements.
- The Tending check-in is based on the strategy timing, not a generic reminder.

### 7. Stage 4 No-Shared-Agreement Close State

State: both users made selections, but there is no overlap in shared proposals.

```text
+------------------------------------+
| Agreements                    ...  |
+------------------------------------+
| AI                                 |
| It looks like there is not a       |
| shared proposal you both want to   |
| try right now. We can still close  |
| with what became clearer.          |
|                                    |

|   |                            |   |
|   | No shared agreement chosen |   |
|   | - Sunday planning: chosen  |   |
|   |   by you only              |   |
|   | - Daily check-in: chosen   |   |
|   |   by partner only          |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Individual commitments     |   |
|   | - You: give a direct       |   |
|   |   heads-up when plans feel |   |
|   |   shaky                    |   |
|   | - Partner: pause before    |   |
|   |   responding defensively   |   |
|   |                            |   |
|   | Needs still open           |   |

| one thing you want to remember     |

Behavior notes:

- The state is a valid close, not an error or retry screen.
- Passive Tending remains available from the session record.
- There is no scheduled shared check-in unless a timed agreement exists.

### 8. Tending Re-entry Surface

State: the user returns to a past session from history, a notification, or a passive entry point.

### 9. Strategy-Timed Tending Check-In

State: a shared agreement had an event-based timing, so Tending asks after that strategy should have happened.
