        subgraph Header
            Cancel[Cancel]
            Title[New Session]
        end

        subgraph InviteNew[Invite Someone New]
            EmailInput[Enter email or phone]
        end

        subgraph OrDivider[Or choose someone you know]
            Divider[Divider Line]
        end

        subgraph ExistingList[Existing People]
            Person1[Alex - No active session]
            Person2[Jordan - No active session]
        end

        subgraph InnerOption[Just need to process alone]
            InnerBtn[Start Inner Work instead]
        end
    end
```

### Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cancel | Returns to previous screen |
| Email/Phone Input | For inviting new people |
| Existing People | Only shows people without active sessions |
| Inner Work Option | Escape hatch for solo processing |

### Existing Person Filter

Only people without an active session appear in the list. People with active sessions are excluded since each relationship can only have one active session.

## Screen 2: Topic Input

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph TopicScreen[Whats on your mind]
        subgraph Header2
            Back[Back]
            Title2[New Session]
        end

        subgraph PersonPreview[Session with]
            Avatar[Avatar]
            Name[Alex or new email]
        end

        subgraph TopicArea[Topic]
            Prompt[Briefly whats on your mind]
            TopicInput2[Text input area]
            Hint[e.g. How we split household tasks]
        end

        subgraph Explanation[Helper Text]
            ExplainText[This helps frame the session. You can explore deeper once you begin.]
        end

        subgraph SendArea[Action]
            SendBtn[Send Invitation]
        end
    end
```

### Topic Input Guidelines

| Guideline | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Keep it brief | Just enough to frame the session |
| No blame language | Sets constructive tone |
| Topic not resolution | Describe the situation not the solution |

### Helper Text

"This helps frame the session. You can explore deeper once you begin."

Reassures users they do not need to explain everything upfront.

        end

        subgraph NextSteps[While You Wait]

            Tip2[The session will appear in your People list]

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Status | Invited |
| Subtitle | Waiting for response |
| Time | Sent 2h ago |

        subgraph Actions[Actions]
            CancelInvite[Cancel invitation]
        end
    end
```

## Partner Accepts

When partner accepts the invitation:

1. User receives notification
2. Person card updates to show "Stage 0 - Ready to begin"
3. Hero card surfaces the session
4. Tapping leads to Session Dashboard then Stage 0

```mermaid
