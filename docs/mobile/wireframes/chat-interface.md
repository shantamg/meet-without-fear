# Chat Interface

The primary conversation interface where users interact with the AI.

## Core Chat Layout

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph ChatScreen[Chat Interface]
        subgraph Header[Chat Header]
            StageTitle[Stage 1: The Witness]
            StageDesc[Share your perspective]
            ProgressDots[Progress indicators]
            RightAction[Right action slot - optional]
        end

        subgraph Messages[Message Area - Scrollable]
            AI1[AI: Welcome message]
            User1[User: Response]
            AI2[AI: Reflection]
            User2[User: More detail]
            AI3[AI: Deeper reflection]
            Typing[AI is composing...]
        end

        subgraph Input[Input Area - Fixed]
            EmotionCheck[Feeling: 5/10]
            TextField[Type your thoughts...]
            SendButton[Send]
        end
    end
```

**Chat header right action**: `SessionChatHeader` accepts an optional `rightAction: { icon, onPress, accessibilityLabel }` prop. Currently used to surface a share icon when the partner's status is "pending invitation" — tapping it opens the invitation-share modal so the user can resend or copy their invite link without leaving the chat screen.

## Message Bubbles

### AI Message

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph AIBubble[AI Message]
        Avatar[AI Avatar]
        Content[Message content with
        warm supportive tone
        and reflection]
        Time[2:34 PM]
    end
```

Characteristics:
- Left-aligned
- Subtle background color
- AI avatar/icon
- A typing indicator ("ghost dots") appears while the user is waiting for the AI's reply — it's derived from cache state (the last message role is `USER`, meaning the AI hasn't answered yet) and from pending mutations like `isFetchingInitialMessage` / `isConfirmingFeelHeard` / `isSharingEmpathy` / `isConfirmingInvitation`. Dots hide as soon as the first AI chunk arrives via SSE / Ably.
  - **Recovery mechanism**: If the typing indicator appears to be stuck (e.g., due to a fire-and-forget Ably message drop during an invitation modal dismiss), a 10-second recovery timer automatically refetches messages. This clears the stuck state without user intervention. The recovery timer is triggered when awaiting invitation or empathy validation follow-ups.
- **AI error feedback**: when an Ably `onAIError` event arrives (e.g. the backend failed to process the user's message), the optimistic message is rolled back (dots hide automatically) and a toast is shown: *"Something went wrong — Your message could not be processed. Please try again."* This is triggered via `useToast().showError` in `UnifiedSessionScreen`.

### User Message

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph UserBubble[User Message]
        UserContent[User message content
        can be multiple lines
        and as long as needed]
        UserTime[2:35 PM]
        Status[Sent]
    end
```

Characteristics:
- Right-aligned
- User-colored background
- Timestamp
- Sent/read status

### Shared Context Card

When a user shares their Stage 2 context (empathy attempt) with their partner, it appears inline in the chat timeline as a distinct card (`isSharedContext` bubble type):

- **Receiver-side**: left-aligned — partner sees it on the left like an AI message
- **Sender-side**: right-aligned — the sharing user sees their own card on the right (`message.sharedContentDirection === 'sent'` triggers `sharedContextSentContainer`)
- After sharing, the shared context card appears inline in the timeline — no drawer or modal auto-opens. (The `ActivityDrawer` / `ActivityMenuModal` were removed in #602; sharing history is no longer surfaced via a separate drawer.)

## Stage-Specific Variations

### Stage 0: Onboarding Chat

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph OnboardingChat[Onboarding View]
        Header0[Welcome to Meet Without Fear]

        subgraph Content0[AI Welcome Message]
            Message[Brief warm opening with typewriter effect]
        end

        subgraph Actions0[Stage 0 Actions]
            Draft[Invitation draft]
            Topic[AI topic frame confirmation]
            Share[Share invitation]
        end
    end
```

The invite drafting phase uses a two-step bottom panel:

1. **Topic confirmation** — The panel first shows only the AI-proposed neutral 3-5 word topic frame with an optional steering input and a confirm button. The invitation message and share controls are hidden.
2. **Invitation sharing** — Once the topic is confirmed, the panel transitions to show the drafted invite message, the confirmed topic, the share button, a refine option, and the "sent it" continuation.

### Stage 1: The Witness Chat

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph WitnessChat[The Witness View]
        Header1[Stage 1: The Witness]

        subgraph Chat1[Open Conversation]
            AI11[Take your time. What would you like to share?]
            User11[User shares perspective]
            AI12[So what I hear is... Is that right?]
        end

        subgraph Completion1[Completion Check - Appears Later]
            HeardQ[Do you feel fully heard?]
            NotYet[Not yet - tell me more]
            YesHeard[Yes I feel heard]
        end
    end
```

### Stage 2: Perspective Stretch Chat

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph StretchChat[Perspective Stretch View]
        Header2[Stage 2: Imagine their side]

        subgraph StageCards[Inline Stage 2 Cards]
            Draft[View your empathy attempt]
            Share[Share suggestion panel]
            Validate[Accuracy feedback card]
        end

        subgraph Chat2[Reflection Conversation]
            AI21[AI helps build or revise empathy]
            User21[User response]
            AI22[AI reflection or Mirror Intervention]
        end

        subgraph FeedbackCoach[Feedback Coach Modal]
            Rough[What feels off?]
            Coach[Guided draft chat]
            Send[Send refined validation feedback]
        end
    end
```

### Stage 3: What Matters Chat

```mermaid

    subgraph NeedChat[What Matters View]
        Header3[Stage 3: Finding Common Ground]

        subgraph NeedPanels[Need Panels]

        end

        subgraph CommonPanel[Common Ground]

        end

        subgraph Chat3[Exploration]
            AI31[AI explores needs]
        end
    end
```

### Stage 4: Strategic Repair ("Moving Forward Together")

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph RepairChat[Strategic Repair View]
        Header4[Stage 4: Moving Forward]

        subgraph Chat4[Main Chat - Surface 1]
            AI41[AI facilitates guided proposal work]
            User41[User responds / brainstorms needs]
        end

        subgraph ProposalArea[Proposals]
            YourProp[Your proposal linked to open need]
            PropResponse[Willing / Not willing]
        end

        subgraph SubChatDrawer[Sub-Chat Drawer - Surfaces 2-4]
            SC1[Needs brainstorm subchat]
            SC2[Proposal refinement subchat]
            SC3[No-overlap subchat]
        end

        subgraph TendingArea[Tending Check-In - Surface 7]
            Tending[How are you tending to yourself?]
        end
    end
```

**Sub-chat drawer pattern**: Surfaces 2–4 open as a bottom drawer (guided sub-chat) layered over the main chat. Each sub-chat has its own AI persona and is dismissed when the user completes the guided flow, returning them to the main chat (Surface 1) with any generated content (needs list, refined proposal, etc.) carried forward.

**Proposal responses use two options only**: "Willing" / "Not willing" — there is no "Discuss" / `NEEDS_DISCUSSION` option in the UI.

### Resolved session history view

When a session is in `RESOLVED` status, users can scroll back through the full chat history (`viewingResolvedHistory = true`). While in this mode a `GuidedActionPanel` (tone `review`) appears above the input:

- **Eyebrow**: "Resolved"
- **Title**: "A Path Forward"
- **Subtitle**: "Return to the summary of what you and your partner agreed."
- **Primary action**: "View summary" — tapping sets `viewingResolvedHistory` back to `false` and returns the user to the Stage 4 summary view.

This panel is rendered by `renderAboveInput` and wired via the condition `session?.status === SessionStatus.RESOLVED && viewingResolvedHistory`.

## Session entry flow

Before the chat list renders, `UnifiedSessionScreen` checks three guard states in order:

1. **Loading** — shows spinner + "Loading session..." while the `/state` endpoint (and retries) are in flight.
2. **Load error** — if the state fetch fails (network timeout, offline, server error) after React Query retries are exhausted, shows "Couldn't load session" with a **Retry** button and a **Go back** link. The existing `AppState` foreground listener also auto-retries when the app returns from background.
3. **Access denied** — 403/404 shows "You don't have access to this session." with a Go back link.

After these guards pass, the mood check may appear (`SessionEntryMoodCheck`) if `shouldShowMoodCheck` is true. Only after the user submits (or dismisses) the mood reading does the usual chat layout show.

## App-level overlays

### Biometric Lock (`BiometricLockOverlay`)

When the app returns from background after ≥5 seconds, `BiometricLockOverlay` covers the entire screen and prompts the user for biometric or device passcode authentication. On success the overlay dismisses. The context (`BiometricLockContext`) tracks lock state; the web variant is a no-op.

### Notification Permission (`NotificationPermissionDrawer`)

After a session turn completes, `useNotifications.ts` evaluates `shouldAskForSessionNotifications()`. When conditions are met the app shows a full-screen `NotificationPermissionDrawer` with the copy: *"Know when it is your turn again"* and a preview of the notification ("Your partner is ready"). Accepting calls `requestSessionNotifications()` which triggers the OS permission dialog and registers the Expo push token.

### Native App Update Prompt (`UpdateBanner`)

`useVersionCheck` polls `GET /api/version/check` on app foreground. When the backend signals an update is available, `UpdateBanner` is rendered as a full-screen modal overlay on top of the app:

- **Required update** — user cannot dismiss; prompted to update now with a download link.
- **Optional update** — user can dismiss ("Maybe later") or tap "Update now."

The hook checks once per app session and respects a per-device snooze so optional prompts don't repeat within the same session. Version info (latest build number, minimum required build, download URLs) is configured via `APP_*` environment variables on the backend.

## Empty States

### Opening not acknowledged (onboarding)

If the caller enters a session but hasn't acknowledged the opening message, the list replaces its usual empty state with a `CompactChatItem` (a brief AI welcome message). A "Ready" button appears above the input via `CompactAgreementBar`. This is controlled by `isInOnboardingUnsigned` / `customEmptyState`.

### Waiting for Partner

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph WaitingState[Waiting State]
        WaitIcon[Hourglass or calm illustration]
        WaitTitle[Waiting for partner]
        WaitMessage[Your partner has not completed
        this stage yet. You can
        review your progress or
        take a break.]
        WaitActions[Review my sharing - Take a break]
    end
```

### Session Not Started

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph NotStarted[Session Not Started]
        NSIcon[Envelope illustration]
        NSTitle[Invitation sent]
        NSMessage[Your partner has not
        accepted the invitation yet.
        We will notify you when
        they join.]
        NSActions[Resend invitation - Edit message]
    end
```

## Input Area Details

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph InputDetailed[Input Area Detail]
        subgraph EmotionMini[Emotion Indicator]
            EmoLabel[Feeling:]
            EmoValue[5]
            EmoSlider[Small slider or tap to expand]
        end

        subgraph TextInput[Text Input]
            Placeholder[Share your thoughts...]
            TextArea[Expandable text area]
            CharCount[Optional character count]
        end

        subgraph Actions[Actions]
            Attach[Attach file]
            Send[Send arrow]
        end
    end
```

## Attachment Support

Not implemented. The message input accepts text only (`sendMessage(message: string)`); there is no attachment button, file picker, or attachment preview in `UnifiedSessionScreen` or `ChatInterface`. Documented here only as a deferred design idea — remove from wireframes before shipping if it doesn't make the roadmap.

## Integrated emotional barometer

The chat input hosts an inline emotion slider (`barometerValue` / `handleBarometerChange`). Readings ≥9 automatically open the `support-options` overlay to surface coping exercises before the user continues typing.

## Guided Action Panel

`GuidedActionPanel` is a unified component (added in #446) that replaced six separate inline action surfaces with a single consistent pattern. It accepts a `tone` prop that controls color/icon and a `primaryAction` (and optional secondary). Current tones:

| Tone | Used for |
|---|---|
| `topic` | Stage 0 — topic-frame confirmation above the input |
| `review` | Stage 2 — empathy draft review / revisit; resolved sessions — back-to-summary CTA while viewing chat history |
| `share` | Stage 2 — share suggestion |
| `success` | Stage 1 — feel-heard confirmation |
| `needs` | Stage 3 — needs reveal / validate |

Each panel shows an eyebrow label, title, optional subtitle, and one or two action buttons. The input field remains visible while any `GuidedActionPanel` is displayed — it is not hidden by the panel (this is intentional: users can continue the conversation even while an action is pending).

**Compact mode**: `GuidedActionPanel` accepts a `compact` prop (boolean) and a `pressable` prop that render the panel as a condensed single-line row instead of the full card layout. Used when the action needs to stay unobtrusive inline — e.g. `ShareTopicPanel` renders with `compact={true} pressable={true}` to show a tappable row rather than a full bottom card.

## Typewriter + inline Stage 2 cards

The chat list tracks `isTypewriterAnimating` (set while a new AI message is being typed in) so it can delay the appearance of inline cards until the text has finished. In Stage 2 (`PERSPECTIVE_STRETCH`), the list renders **validation cards** directly in the timeline (`validationCards`) with "Accurate / Partially / Off" buttons wired to `handleValidationAccurate` / `handleValidationNotQuite` instead of routing users to a separate screen. The "Not quite yet" path opens `AccuracyFeedbackDrawer` for rough notes and then `GuidedDraftChatModal` as the Feedback Coach before the final feedback is submitted.

## Stage color bars and sticky header

Each stage transition is visually marked in the chat timeline by a full-width colored stage bar (`ChatIndicator` with `type: 'stage-chapter'`). These bars carry `metadata.stageColor` and use a fixed emotional-arc palette defined in `shared/src/enums.ts` (`STAGE_COLORS`):

| Stage | Color |
|---|---|
| `ONBOARDING` | Blue (`#8B9DC3`) |
| `WITNESS` | Tan/amber (`#D4A574`) |
| `PERSPECTIVE_STRETCH` | Green (`#8FAF8F`) |
| `NEED_MAPPING` | Purple (`#9B8EC4`) |
| `STRATEGIC_REPAIR` | Coral (`#C4886E`) |

When a stage bar scrolls past the top of the viewport, `ChatInterface` uses `stickyHeaderIndices` to pin it as a sticky overlay at the top of the list. The sticky header shows the stage name and is hidden when the inline bar is still visible (no duplication). This gives users persistent context about which stage they're in while scrolling through long conversations.

## Stage label map

The screen uses this friendly-name map when rendering the stage header:

| Internal enum | UI label |
|---|---|
| `Stage.ONBOARDING` | Welcome |
| `Stage.WITNESS` | Share what's on your mind |
| `Stage.PERSPECTIVE_STRETCH` | Imagine their side |
| `Stage.NEED_MAPPING` | Find what you both need |
| `Stage.INFORMED_EMPATHY` | Deeper Understanding |
| `Stage.STRATEGIC_REPAIR` | Moving Forward Together |
