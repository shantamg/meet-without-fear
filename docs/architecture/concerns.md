# Codebase Concerns

**Analysis Date:** 2026-03-11

## Tech Debt

**Large, Monolithic Components (Partially Resolved):**
- Issue: Multiple components exceed 1500+ lines of code, making them difficult to maintain and test
- Files:
  - `mobile/src/screens/UnifiedSessionScreen.tsx` (2722 lines, reduced from 3096 — extracted `session/SessionAboveInputPanel.tsx`, `session/SessionOverlays.tsx`, `session/SessionDrawers.tsx`)
  - `backend/src/controllers/stage2.ts` (2268 lines)
  - ~~`backend/src/services/reconciler.ts` (2320 lines)~~ — **Resolved**: refactored into `reconciler/` directory with `state.ts` (544), `analysis.ts` (610), `sharing.ts` (1173), `circuit-breaker.ts` (102)
  - ~~`mobile/src/hooks/useUnifiedSession.ts` (1218 lines)~~ — **Resolved**: reduced to 711 lines by extracting `useEmpathyActions.ts`, `useNeedsActions.ts`, `useStrategyActions.ts`, `useSessionEventHandler.ts`
- Impact: Reduced but stage2.ts controller still large
- Remaining: `stage2.ts` controller is the last major monolith

**Legacy/Deprecated Code Still Active (Partially Resolved):**
- Issue: Deprecated endpoints and old patterns coexist with new ones, creating confusion and maintenance burden
- Files:
  - `backend/src/controllers/messages.ts` (105) - `sendMessage` endpoint marked DEPRECATED with fire-and-forget pattern still in use
  - ~~`backend/src/services/stage-prompts-legacy.ts` (1899 lines)~~ — **Resolved**: deleted, only `stage-prompts.ts` remains
  - Multiple deprecated test routes in `backend/src/routes/__tests__/messages.test.ts`
- Impact: Reduced — only the deprecated sendMessage endpoint remains
- Fix approach: Schedule removal of deprecated sendMessage endpoint after ensuring all clients migrated to `/messages/stream`.

**Unused/Partially Implemented Features:**
- Issue: Features stubbed out or marked for future implementation
- Files/Examples:
  - `mobile/app/(auth)/person/[id].tsx` (52) - Remove person is wired to UI but API call not implemented (just navigates back)
  - `mobile/app/(auth)/inner-thoughts/index.tsx` (225) - Linking partner sessions disabled (`isLinked = false; // TODO: item.linkedPartnerSessionId`)
  - `backend/src/controllers/stage4.ts` (862) - TODO: Call AI service to generate strategy suggestions
- Impact: Users may believe features work when they don't; incomplete business logic
- Fix approach: Either implement these features or remove UI elements that reference them. Create explicit GitHub issues for deferred work.

## Known Issues & Fragile Areas

**Stage Transition Cache Update Pattern (Critical):**
- Issue: Mobile app uses Cache-First architecture where mutations must manually update `sessionKeys.state` cache with new stage. Failing to do this causes stage-specific panels to not display (e.g., empathy panel won't show if `myProgress.stage` cache is stale).
- Files:
  - `mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts` - Stage mutations
  - `mobile/src/hooks/useChatUIState.ts` - Derives panel visibility from stage cache
  - `CLAUDE.md` line 30: Already documented as fixed in `useConfirmFeelHeard`
- Symptoms: User completes action that should advance to new stage, but no UI updates appear
- Workaround: Refresh/reload to re-fetch fresh stage from server
- Risk: This pattern is not type-safe; easy to miss cache update when adding new stage mutations
- Fix approach: Consider creating a wrapper mutation hook that enforces cache update pattern, or use React Query's `onSuccess` with `invalidateQueries` to auto-refresh

**Reconciler Race Conditions (Partially Resolved):**
- Issue: Reconciler service previously had manual retry logic to handle database visibility issues
- Files: `backend/src/services/reconciler/state.ts` - `checkAndRevealBothIfReady()` now uses serializable transactions to prevent race conditions on mutual reveal
- Progress: Modular refactor introduced explicit state machine (`empathy-state-machine.ts`) and serializable transactions for critical paths
- Remaining: Some retry logic may still exist in share suggestion generation flow (`reconciler/sharing.ts`)

**Reconciliation State Machine Complexity (Partially Resolved):**
- Issue: Reconciler manages complex state transitions (HELD → AWAITING_SHARING → REFINING → REVEALED) with multiple database tables (ReconcilerResult, ReconcilerShareOffer, EmpathyStatus)
- Files: `backend/src/services/reconciler/` (modular directory), `backend/src/services/empathy-state-machine.ts`, `backend/src/controllers/stage2.ts`
- Progress: Formal state machine implemented in `empathy-state-machine.ts` with explicit transition table, `canTransition()`, and `validEventsFor()` — prevents invalid state changes. Loop prevention formalized in `reconciler/circuit-breaker.ts` (max 3 attempts per direction)
- Remaining: State machine is custom (not using XState); adding new reconciliation features still requires careful consideration

**Type-Safety Gaps in useStages.ts:**
- Issue: `useStages.ts` has `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` escapes and circular dependency runtime guards
- Files: `mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts`
- Impact: Type errors may go undetected; runtime guards indicate architectural fragility
- Risk: Refactoring may introduce silent regressions
- Fix approach: Replace `any` escapes with proper generics; resolve circular dependencies at the module level

**Console Logging Explosion (Resolved):**
- ~~Issue: 85+ console.log/warn/error statements in `reconciler.ts` alone~~
- **Resolved**: All `console.*()` calls across the backend replaced with Winston structured logger (`backend/src/lib/logger.ts`). Logger provides log levels, JSON output in production, request context injection, and Sentry transport for errors.

**State Management Explosion in useStages.ts (Partially Resolved):**
- Issue: 29 direct `queryClient.setQueryData()` calls with no type-safe wrapper
- Files: `mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts`
- Progress: Typed cache helpers created in `mobile/src/hooks/cacheHelpers.ts` — `typedSetQueryData()` and `typedGetQueryData()` provide compile-time key-to-value-type enforcement. New extracted hooks (`useEmpathyActions.ts`, `useNeedsActions.ts`, `useStrategyActions.ts`) use these helpers.
- Remaining: `useStages.ts` itself still has direct `setQueryData` calls that could be migrated to the typed helpers

**Circuit Breaker Pattern (Rewritten):**
- The circuit breaker utility (`backend/src/utils/circuit-breaker.ts`) has been completely rewritten with a full 3-state pattern (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN)
- Three service-level instances: `bedrockCircuitBreaker`, `embeddingCircuitBreaker`, `ablyCircuitBreaker`
- Configuration: failureThreshold (5), cooldownMs (30s), timeoutMs (20s)
- Methods: `execute()`, `executeWithFallback()`, `recordSuccess()`, `recordFailure()`, `getStats()`
- Impact: E2E test runs can still take 8-12 minutes when hitting LLM timeouts
- Risk: E2E tests may fail intermittently based on LLM service health
- Mitigation: Circuit breaker provides fallback values; fast-fail when OPEN state prevents cascading failures

---

## Performance Bottlenecks

**Large AI Service Calls Block User Response:**
- Issue: Some services use `withTimeout` with circuit breakers but still perform expensive operations in user request path
- Files:
  - `backend/src/services/memory-detector.ts` (203) - Slow Haiku calls wrapped but still in response path
  - `backend/src/services/partner-session-classifier.ts` (519) - Circuit breaker prevents blocking but still called per request
  - `backend/src/services/background-classifier.ts` (254) - Non-blocking pattern used
- Recommendations: Continue using fire-and-forget pattern for optional enrichment; ensure all blocking calls have reasonable timeouts (<5s)

**N+1 Query Risk in Reconciler:**
- Issue: Reconciler builds context by fetching user messages, themes, empathy statements separately. If session has many messages, could cause multiple database round-trips
- Files: `backend/src/services/reconciler/analysis.ts` - `getWitnessingContent`, `extractThemes`, `analyzeEmpathyGap`
- Risk: Higher latency with larger sessions
- Mitigation: Prisma relations are properly defined; queries use includes/selects when needed
- Recommendation: Monitor slow query logs; consider pagination if sessions grow beyond 1000 messages

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

**Critical Services Lack Unit Tests:**
- Issue: Major backend services have no dedicated test files
- Tested services (14): ai, context-assembler, dispatch-handler, memory-detector, memory-intent, memory-validator, partner-session-classifier, people-extractor, push, realtime, reconciler-offer-optional, semantic-router-integration, stage-prompts, stage-tools
- Newly added tests:
  - `backend/src/services/__tests__/ai-orchestrator.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/__tests__/context-retriever.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/__tests__/crisis-detector.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/__tests__/empathy-state-machine.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/__tests__/input-sanitizer.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/services/__tests__/reconciler.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/utils/__tests__/circuit-breaker.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/utils/__tests__/field-encryption.test.ts`
  - `backend/src/lib/__tests__/bedrock-streaming.test.ts`
- Still untested (high-impact):
  - `backend/src/services/embedding.ts` (16.4KB) - Vector embedding service
  - `backend/src/services/conversation-summarizer.ts` (22.5KB) - Session summarization
  - `backend/src/services/needs.ts` (session needs logic)
- Impact: Core services now have test coverage; remaining gaps are lower priority
- Fix approach: Continue adding tests for embedding, summarizer, and needs services

**Mobile E2E Test Brittleness:**
- Issue: Live AI E2E test (`e2e/tests/live-ai-full-flow.spec.ts`) depends on external service health (partner-session-classifier circuit breaker adds 20s timeout per response per MEMORY.md)
- Files: `e2e/tests/live-ai-full-flow.spec.ts`
- Impact: Test may timeout intermittently; hard to debug flakiness
- Workaround: MOCK_LLM=true for faster local tests
- Recommendation: Continue with mocked tests for CI; reserve live AI test for scheduled deep validation runs

**No Tests for Person Deletion/Linking:**
- Issue: Incomplete features (`mobile/app/(auth)/person/[id].tsx` remove, inner thoughts linking) have no test coverage because they're not fully implemented
- Fix approach: Implement features and add tests, or remove incomplete UI elements

---

## Scaling & Capacity Concerns

**Session Message Growth:**
- Issue: UnifiedSessionScreen fetches messages with infinite scroll (`hasMoreMessages` flag, `fetchMoreMessages` callback)
- Files: `mobile/src/screens/UnifiedSessionScreen.tsx`, `mobile/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`
- Current design: Good (pagination support built in)
- Concern: Large sessions (1000+ messages) may slow down:
  - Reconciler context assembly (fetches all user messages to build context)
  - Mobile UI rendering (infinite scroll list)
- Mitigation: Message list uses pagination; reconciler uses message window, not full history
- Recommendation: Monitor session sizes; consider caching reconciler context if sessions exceed 2000 messages

**Realtime Connection Scalability:**
- Issue: Each session maintains Ably connection for real-time updates (`mobile/src/hooks/useRealtime.ts`, `backend/src/services/realtime.ts`)
- Current design: One connection per mobile session, fire-and-forget updates to partner
- Concern: Multiple concurrent sessions × many users = significant Ably bandwidth
- Mitigation: Production Ably plan is presumed to support expected user base
- Recommendation: Monitor Ably metrics; set up alerts for connection errors or message backlog

---

## Security Considerations

**E2E Auth Bypass (Not Resolved):**
- Issue: E2E auth bypass (`E2E_AUTH_BYPASS=true` environment variable) is built into production auth middleware
- Status: `backend/src/middleware/e2e-auth.ts` was created but is **never imported** anywhere. The bypass logic (`handleE2EAuthBypass()`, lines 74-121) still lives inline in `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`. The bypass was duplicated to a separate file but not actually extracted from `auth.ts` — production auth middleware still contains E2E bypass logic.
- Remaining mitigation: Environment variable check still needed; CORS restrictions + route-level guards provide additional protection

**No Input Validation on Controller Parameters:**
- Issue: Controllers receive route parameters directly without schema validation; request bodies validated but route params may not be
- Files: Multiple controllers, e.g., `backend/src/controllers/stage2.ts` uses `req.params.id` without explicit zod/joi schema check
- Risk: Edge cases (missing IDs, malformed UUIDs) may cause unexpected database errors instead of clean 400 response
- Mitigation: Prisma handles invalid IDs gracefully; authorization checks verify user owns resource
- Recommendation: Add middleware to validate route params against schema (e.g., `is-valid-cuid()`)

## Fragile Areas Requiring Careful Modification

**Mobile Cache-First Architecture:**
- Files: `mobile/src/hooks/queryKeys.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts`, `mobile/src/hooks/useSessions.ts`
- Fragility: Query key mismatches cause writes to cache keys nobody reads from; stage updates must be coordinated between multiple hooks
- Safe modification:
  1. Always check `queryKeys.ts` definitions before creating new cache writes
  2. Test mutation + cache update with React Query DevTools
  3. Verify UI updates by checking `useChatUIState` derives correct visibility
  4. Test reload/refresh to ensure derived UI state matches server truth

**Reconciler Empathy Status Machine:**
- Files: `backend/src/services/reconciler/` (modular directory), `backend/src/services/empathy-state-machine.ts`, `backend/src/controllers/stage2.ts`, `backend/src/services/empathy-status.ts`
- Fragility: Multiple tables track related state; cascading deletes may orphan records
- Safe modification:
  1. Use `empathy-state-machine.ts` transition table to validate state changes — `canTransition()` prevents invalid transitions
  2. Check both ReconcilerResult and EmpathyStatus when changing empathy state
  3. Run reconciler tests (`services/__tests__/reconciler.test.ts`, `services/__tests__/empathy-state-machine.test.ts`) after changes
  4. Reconciler circuit breaker (`reconciler/circuit-breaker.ts`) limits refinement loops to max 3 per direction

**Stage Prompts System:**
- Files: `backend/src/services/stage-prompts.ts` (legacy file deleted)
- Fragility: Stage-specific instructions embedded in prompt templates; changes affect AI behavior globally
- Safe modification:
  1. Make prompt changes in stage-prompts.ts (the only prompts file now)
  2. Test with prompt-test scripts before committing
  3. Run live AI E2E test to validate AI still understands stage intent
  4. Document any new prompt tags in comments (e.g., `<thinking>`, `<draft>`)

---

## Missing or Unclear Documentation

**Cache Key Pattern Not Type-Safe:**
- Issue: Query keys defined as string arrays in `queryKeys.ts`; no enforcement that keys used in `useQuery` match keys used in `setQueryData`
- Files: `mobile/src/hooks/queryKeys.ts`, all stage hooks
- Impact: Silent cache misses when keys don't match exactly
- Fix approach: Consider migrating to typed query key factory pattern (e.g., QueryClient `@tanstack/solid-query` style)

**AI Orchestrator Request Routing Logic Undocumented:**
- Issue: `routeModel()` and `scoreAmbiguity()` in `backend/src/services/model-router.ts` decide which model (Haiku/Sonnet/Claude) handles a request; logic not well documented
- Impact: Hard to understand why certain requests route to certain models
- Recommendation: Add docstring explaining routing decision logic; document model cost/latency tradeoffs

**Model Router Has Undocumented Magic Numbers:**
- Issue: `scoreAmbiguity()` uses hardcoded weights (0.2, 0.15) and `routeModel()` uses a threshold of `>= 4` to decide Sonnet vs Haiku, with additive scoring (+4 for mediate, +3 for high-intensity, etc.) — none of these values are documented or justified
- Files: `backend/src/services/model-router.ts` (25-78)
- Impact: Impossible to tune routing behavior without understanding the scoring model; magic numbers make cost/quality tradeoffs opaque
- Fix approach: Add docstring explaining scoring rationale; consider extracting thresholds to named constants

**Scattered TODOs Across Critical Paths:**
- Issue: Incomplete implementations marked with TODO comments in production code
- Files:
  - `backend/src/controllers/people.ts` (128) — `TODO: sum all counts` for frequent sort
  - `backend/src/services/context-assembler.ts` (427) — `TODO: Extract from UserVessel` (themes always empty array)
  - `mobile/src/screens/UnifiedSessionScreen.tsx` (686) — `TODO: Show error toast or UI indicator`
- Impact: Missing functionality silently degrades behavior (e.g., empty themes array in context assembly)
- Fix approach: Triage TODOs — implement or create tracked issues; remove stale ones

**Reconciler Logging (Resolved):**
- ~~Issue: `reconciler.ts` contains 85 console.log/warn/error calls with no structured format~~
- **Resolved**: All logging migrated to Winston structured logger. Reconciler modules (`reconciler/state.ts`, `reconciler/analysis.ts`, `reconciler/sharing.ts`) use `logger.info/warn/error` with automatic request context injection (turnId, sessionId, userId).

**Query Key Type-Safety Gap:**
- Issue: Query keys in `queryKeys.ts` are string arrays (`['sessions', id, 'state'] as const`). Nothing prevents a `setQueryData` call from using a key that differs by one segment from what `useQuery` reads — these mismatches cause silent cache misses
- Files: `mobile/src/hooks/queryKeys.ts`, all hooks using `queryClient.setQueryData()`
- Impact: Bugs from key mismatches are invisible at compile time and hard to detect at runtime
- Fix approach: Consider typed query key factory pattern or wrapper functions that enforce key/value type consistency

**Reconciler Test Coverage (Resolved):**
- ~~Issue: `reconciler.ts` (2320 lines) had zero direct unit or integration tests~~
- **Resolved**: Reconciler refactored into modular `reconciler/` directory and now has direct test coverage via `backend/src/services/__tests__/reconciler.test.ts`. Empathy state machine transitions tested in `backend/src/services/__tests__/empathy-state-machine.test.ts`. Route-level tests also updated in `backend/src/routes/__tests__/reconciler.test.ts`.

## Dependencies at Risk

**Bedrock/Claude API Dependence:**
- Risk: Entire AI system depends on AWS Bedrock for Claude models
- Mitigation: Circuit breakers prevent total failure; fallbacks return safe responses
- Recommendation: Monitor Bedrock health; have contingency plan if service is unavailable (e.g., maintenance mode)

**Expo/React Native Ecosystem:**
- Risk: Mobile app built on Expo; platform relies on rapid Expo/RN updates for iOS/Android compatibility
- Mitigation: Expo handles most compatibility concerns
- Recommendation: Keep Expo SDK and RN versions current; test on real devices during major upgrades

---

## Deferred Work / Known Limitations

**Person Removal Not Wired:**
- Status: UI exists but no backend implementation
- Impact: Users can open remove dialog but action is no-op
- Issue: `mobile/app/(auth)/person/[id].tsx` (52)

**Inner Thoughts Linking Not Complete:**
- Status: Schema supports linking inner work sessions to partner sessions; mobile UI prepared but feature disabled
- Impact: Intended feature to reflect during partner sessions not available
- Issue: `mobile/app/(auth)/inner-thoughts/index.tsx` (225)

**Strategy Suggestion Generation Missing:**
- Status: UI prepares for AI-generated strategy suggestions; AI call not hooked up
- Impact: Users see strategy UI but suggestions are hardcoded/empty
- Issue: `backend/src/controllers/stage4.ts` (862)

**Bell Sound for Typing Indicator Not Implemented:**
- Status: Code comments indicate intent but no audio asset loaded
- Issue: `mobile/src/hooks/useSpeech.ts` (471)

---

## Database & Migration Concerns

**Database Transaction Usage (Partially Resolved):**
- Issue: Multi-step operations historically lacked explicit transactions
- Progress: Transactions now used in critical reconciler paths — `reconciler/state.ts` uses serializable transactions in `checkAndRevealBothIfReady()` to prevent race conditions on mutual reveal
- Remaining: Some non-critical multi-step operations still lack explicit transactions
- Files: `backend/src/services/reconciler/state.ts`
- Mitigation: Cascading deletes defined in Prisma schema handle cleanup

**Migration Files Not Audited:**
- Issue: Prisma migrations exist but no review of migration safety/rollback procedures
- Impact: Uncertain if old migrations can rollback cleanly
- Recommendation: Document migration testing procedure; keep backup before production migrations
