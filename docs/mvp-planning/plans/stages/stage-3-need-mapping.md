# Stage 3: Need Mapping

## Purpose

Transition from surface-level stories and complaints to identifying universal human needs that both parties share.

## AI Goal

- Synthesize underlying needs from each users sharing
- Translate complaints and positions into needs language
- Identify at least one common-ground need
- Reframe accusations into I-statements and needs

## From Stories to Needs

```mermaid

    subgraph Stories[Surface Level]
        S1[They never listen to me]
        S2[They always criticize]
        S3[They work too much]
    end

    subgraph Emotions[Emotional Layer]
        E1[Feeling unimportant]
        E2[Feeling inadequate]
        E3[Feeling lonely]
    end

    subgraph Needs[Universal Needs]
        N1[Need for recognition]
        N2[Need for acceptance]
        N3[Need for connection]
    end

    S1 --> E1 --> N1
    S2 --> E2 --> N2
    S3 --> E3 --> N3
```

## Universal Needs Framework

The AI maps to universal human needs:

| Category | Example Needs |
|----------|---------------|
| **Safety** | Security, stability, predictability, protection |
| **Connection** | Belonging, intimacy, closeness, understanding |
| **Autonomy** | Freedom, choice, independence, self-determination |
| **Recognition** | Appreciation, acknowledgment, respect, being seen |
| **Meaning** | Purpose, contribution, growth, significance |
| **Fairness** | Justice, equality, reciprocity, balance |

## Accusation Reframing

The AI transforms accusatory language:

| Original Statement | Reframed to Needs |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "You never help around the house" | "I have a need for partnership and shared responsibility" |
| "You always take their side" | "I need to feel like you are on my team" |
| "You care more about work than me" | "I need quality time and to feel prioritized" |

        subgraph YourNeeds[Your Identified Needs]

            Need1[Safety - feeling secure in the relationship]
            Need2[Recognition - being seen for your efforts]

        end

        end

        subgraph Confirm[Confirmation]
            Question[Does this capture what you need?]
            Yes[Yes this is right]
            Adjust[I want to adjust]
        end
    end
```

## Success Criteria

At least one common-ground need is identified and confirmed by both parties.

## Common Ground Discovery

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph UserA[User A Needs]
        A1[Safety]
        A2[Recognition]
        A3[Autonomy]
    end

    subgraph UserB[User B Needs]
        B1[Connection]
        B2[Safety]
        B3[Fairness]
    end

    A1 --- Common{Common: Safety}
    B2 --- Common

    Common --> Highlight[Both need Safety]
    Highlight --> Build[Build on this foundation]
```

## Failure Paths

| Scenario | AI Response |
|----------|-------------|
| No obvious overlap | Dig deeper - surface needs often share deeper roots |
| User rejects need synthesis | Refine and re-present; ask clarifying questions |
| Accusatory language persists | Apply reframing; return to Stage 2 if needed |
| One user dominates narrative | Balance attention; ensure both needs are mapped |

## Data Captured

- Identified needs for each user
- Common ground discovered
- Reframing transformations applied
- Confirmation of accuracy
