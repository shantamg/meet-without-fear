## At a Glance

Meet Without Fear acts as an **External Prefrontal Cortex** for people in conflict. Instead of users communicating directly (which escalates tension), they interact with an AI that:

1. **Maintains regulation** - Tracks emotional intensity and enforces cooling periods
2. **Preserves memory** - Keeps accurate records without distortion
3. **Controls pacing** - Prevents advancement until both parties are ready
4. **Teaches skills** - Builds listening, reflection, and needs-based understanding
