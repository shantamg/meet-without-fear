# Backend Architecture

Technical documentation for the BeHeard backend - a **stateful, stage-gated, privacy-partitioned facilitation engine**.

## Core Principle

> BeHeard is NOT a chatbot. It is a Process Guardian that enforces stage-scoped memory contracts.

## Non-Negotiable Architectural Rules

These rules are constitutional and must never be compromised:

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Partner raw data is never retrieved | Privacy is absolute between vessels |
| Consent is transactional, revocable, and enforced at query time | Trust requires real-time consent checking |
| Vector search is never used to recall agreements or decisions | Trust-affecting data must be deterministic |
| The large model never decides what to retrieve or share | AI receives pre-assembled context only |
| AI Synthesis objects may influence retrieval planning but may never be injected directly into generation context | Prevents hallucination and privacy leakage |

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **ORM**: Prisma with RLS middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + pgvector + Row-Level Security
- **Queue**: Redis + BullMQ (async notifications, airlock)
- **AI Models**: Small model (mechanics) + Large model (facilitation)

## Dual-Layer Data Strategy

```
Binary decisions (Consent, Stage Gates, Agreements) → SQL (deterministic)
Nuanced decisions (Emotional similarity, Episodic recall) → Vectors (semantic)
```

## Documentation Sections

### API (coming soon)
REST endpoints, WebSocket, error handling

### Security (coming soon)
Encryption, access control, consent audit

### [Glossary](./glossary.md)
Canonical definitions for all BeHeard backend terminology

## Key Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Memory is typed, scoped, gated | Not conversation history - structured objects with access rules |
| Vector search is support tool | Never authority for trust-affecting decisions |
| Small model for mechanics | Stage classification, detection, retrieval planning |
| Large model receives pre-assembled context | Does not decide what to retrieve |
| AI Synthesis is regenerable | Persist inputs, regenerate synthesis |
| Stage-scoped retrieval contracts | Hard rules on what each stage can access |
