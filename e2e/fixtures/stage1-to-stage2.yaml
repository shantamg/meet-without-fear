        I hear the frustration in what you're sharing. Feeling unheard, especially by someone you care about, can be deeply painful. Can you tell me about a specific moment when this happened recently?

    - user: "Last week I tried to tell them about something stressful at work, and they just kept scrolling on their phone. I felt invisible."

        Invisible - that's such a powerful word. When the person who's supposed to be closest to us can't seem to see us, it cuts deep. What did that moment feel like in your body? Sometimes naming where we feel things helps us understand ourselves better.

    - user: "My chest got tight. I just wanted to shut down and walk away. But I stayed, feeling angry and hurt."

        </thinking>

        You stayed even when every part of you wanted to leave. That takes real strength. The tightness in your chest, the anger, the hurt - all of those make complete sense. You were reaching out for connection and hit a wall.

    - user: "Yes, exactly. I just want them to care about what I'm going through."

        What you want is so fundamental - to be cared about, to matter. That's not asking for too much. That's asking for the basic building block of any relationship.

        Before we continue, I want to check in with you. Do you feel heard right now in this conversation? Take a moment to notice how it feels to have your experience acknowledged.

      Thank you for sharing so openly. Now that you've had space to express your experience, I'm wondering if you'd be willing to explore something with me.

      Sometimes when we feel unheard, there's something happening on the other side too - not to excuse it, just to understand. Would you be open to thinking about what might be going on for your partner?
