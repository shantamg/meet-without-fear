        Welcome! Alice invited you here because they want to understand your perspective better. This is a safe space where both of you can be heard.

        Before we begin, I'd like to learn a bit about your side. How are you feeling about this conversation?

        It's completely natural to feel nervous - that actually shows you care about getting this right. Being willing to try, even when uncertain, is a brave first step.

        What's been on your mind about your relationship with Alice? There's no pressure - just share whatever feels right.
