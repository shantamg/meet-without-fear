/**
 * Live AI Full Flow E2E Test
 *
 * Exercises the User A path (Stages 0→2) with MOCK_LLM=false and real AI responses.
 * Proves the full pipeline: prompt → LLM → streaming → micro-tag parsing → SSE → frontend → metadata-driven panels.
 *
 * Uses structural assertions (testIDs, typing indicators) instead of text matching,
 * since real AI responses are non-deterministic.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   npx playwright test --config=e2e/playwright.live-ai.config.ts
