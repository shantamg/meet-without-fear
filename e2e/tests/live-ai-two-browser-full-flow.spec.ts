/**
 * Live AI Two-Browser Full Flow E2E Test
 *
 * Two users + real Bedrock + Stages 0→4. Companion to:
 *   - live-ai-full-flow.spec.ts        (real AI, single user, stages 0-2)
 *   - two-browser-full-flow.spec.ts    (mocked AI, two users, stages 0-4)
 *
 * This spec proves real AI quality across the entire arc with both partners.
 * It is the highest-coverage but slowest scenario in the suite — ~25 min,
 * ~$1-3 in Bedrock per run. Run on demand only via @slam_paws.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - testIDs only (real AI text is non-deterministic)
 *   - generous timeouts (real AI: 50-90s per turn; reconciler: up to 90s)
 *   - no toHaveScreenshot snapshots (chat content varies between runs)
 *
 * Run with:
 *   npx playwright test --config=e2e/playwright.live-ai.config.ts \
 *     --grep live-ai-two-browser-full-flow
