Now back to our conversation about Shantam Galuten. I understand you've been reflecting on communication challenges, particularly around defensiveness and feeling unheard. To help craft the most effective invitation, could you share what kind of conversation you're hoping to have? For instance, is this about improving your communication generally, or is there a specific situation you'd like to discuss together?

**[2026-01-15 03:01:41] Darryl:**
Can you speak more plainly please?

**[2026-01-15 03:01:45] AI:**
Sure, I'll be more direct: What's the main thing you want to talk with Shantam about? Just give it to me straight.

**[2026-01-15 03:02:30] Darryl:**
I want Shantam to know that I am very sensitive to negative feedback. And that he’s always giving me that. I’d like positive feedback only and he doesn’t seem like he can do that

**[2026-01-15 03:02:36] AI:**
I hear you - it's hard when feedback feels constantly negative, especially when you're sensitive to it. Let me suggest a gentle way to start this conversation with Shantam. I've drafted an invitation that opens the door to talking about communication styles without putting anyone on the defensive. Would you like to see what I've prepared?

### 📨 INVITATION SENT to Shantam

## Stage 1

**[2026-01-15 03:09:33] AI:**
You've taken a big step by sending that invitation. While we wait, I'd like to understand more about how all this negative feedback affects you. Can you tell me about a time recently when Shantam's feedback really stung?

**[2026-01-15 03:09:41] Darryl:**
I think maybe I should do some inner work before we invite Shantam. You think this is me being too sensitive?

**[2026-01-15 03:09:47] AI:**
Your feelings about feedback are real and valid - it's not about being 'too sensitive' or 'not sensitive enough.' Since you're opening up about this, could you tell me what happens inside when you receive negative feedback? Like, what thoughts and feelings come up for you in those moments?

**[2026-01-15 03:10:51] Darryl:**
I just feel like I’m not good enough and never will be. I hear that no matter how hard I’m trying, I won’t be loved

**[2026-01-15 03:10:59] AI:**
That sounds really painful - to feel like no matter what you do, it's not enough to be loved. It must be exhausting to carry that feeling, like you're constantly trying to prove your worth. I hear how much this hurts.

**[2026-01-15 03:13:05] Darryl:**
Yea it’s hard. I just feel like I am too soft sometimes so I don’t even want to say anything to people about it

**[2026-01-15 03:13:15] AI:**
It takes real courage to look at these feelings so honestly. You know, being sensitive isn't a flaw - it's actually a strength that lets you understand feelings deeply. But I hear how hard it is to feel this vulnerable, like you have to hide parts of yourself to be accepted. When you say you're 'too soft,' I wonder if what you're really saying is that you wish you could speak up about your needs without feeling like you're doing something wrong?

**[2026-01-15 03:14:11] Darryl:**
Exactly. That’s it. How do I do that?

**[2026-01-15 03:14:22] AI:**
Speaking up about our sensitivity takes real strength. Here's what helps: Start small. Maybe try something like 'Hey, I need to share something that's hard for me to say. When I get feedback, I tend to feel really deeply hurt because it touches on my fear of not being good enough. Could we talk about ways to share feedback that feel safer for both of us?' You don't have to apologize for being sensitive - it's just about letting your partner know what's happening in your heart. What do you think about starting there?

## Stage 2

**[2026-01-15 03:15:26] AI:**
You've shared so beautifully about feeling 'too soft' and that deep fear that no matter how hard you try, you won't be loved. Given how raw and vulnerable these feelings are for you, I'm curious - what do you imagine might be happening for Shantam when they give feedback? What feelings or needs might be underneath their communication style?

**[2026-01-15 03:16:41] Darryl:**
I don’t think he is concerned about it at all. He seems to think about getting things “right” so that’s all he’s focused on.

**[2026-01-15 03:16:50] AI:**
I hear the frustration in your voice. It feels like Shantam is so focused on getting things 'right' that your emotional needs get missed. That must feel really lonely. Can we dig a bit deeper though? When someone is super focused on getting things 'right' - like Shantam seems to be - it often comes from some kind of worry or fear. What kind of pressure or fears do you think might be driving Shantam to focus so much on correctness?

**[2026-01-15 03:23:27] Darryl:**
I don’t know. He’s like a super genius. He is a world class musician, an engineer, and a yoga master. He’s intense about everything and really hard on himself. So he expects that of everyone else too

**[2026-01-15 03:23:36] AI:**
Ah, this helps paint a fuller picture. Someone who's achieved so much and holds themselves to incredibly high standards... that must create a lot of internal pressure. When you describe him being 'intense about everything and really hard on himself,' it sounds like he might carry some heavy expectations - both for himself and others. How do you think it feels for him, living with those high standards all the time? What might that cost him?

**[2026-01-15 03:24:32] Darryl:**
It’s stressful I guess. It must be intense in his world

**[2026-01-15 03:24:41] AI:**
You're starting to see his world from a new angle. Being a 'super genius' who excels at everything might look great from the outside, but it could be pretty lonely and stressful too. When someone sets such high standards for themselves - mastering music, engineering, yoga - they might live with constant pressure to be perfect. What do you think drives him to pursue such perfection? Could there be some fears or insecurities under all that achievement?

**[2026-01-15 03:29:24] Darryl:**
I have no idea. I’m not a super genius. But I’d imagine that people like that put a lot of pressure on themselves. And then everyone is expecting them to be a super genius all the time. So anything they do has this high bar

**[2026-01-15 03:29:36] AI:**
This is such an insightful observation. You're seeing how being known as a 'super genius' might actually be a heavy burden - always having to meet those high expectations, feeling pressure to excel at everything. That constant pressure to maintain such high standards... it could explain why Shantam is so focused on 'getting things right.' It sounds like you're recognizing that his intense approach to feedback might come from the same place as his drive for excellence - not to hurt you, but because it's the lens he's learned to see everything through. Would you like to capture this understanding to share with Shantam?

**📤 YOUR EMPATHY STATEMENT SUBMITTED:
"I think I'm beginning to understand that you see our work together primarily through the lens of technical progress and achievement - that's your natural focus. When you say everything is going well, you're looking at our output and efficiency. I imagine it might be confusing when I bring up emotional concerns because you're so focused on the concrete aspects of our collaboration. Maybe this is part of the same drive for excellence that's helped you master so many areas of your life."**

**I think I'm starting to understand that being known for excellence in so many areas might create a lot of pressure for you. When you give direct feedback, it might come from the same high standards you hold yourself to. I imagine it must be stressful to feel like you always have to maintain that level of perfection, with everyone expecting excellence from you all the time.**

**[2026-01-15 03:30:50] AI:**
Thank you for taking that courageous step to imagine Shantam's experience, Darryl. These moments of trying to see through another's eyes help build real understanding between people. Now, we'll give Shantam space to share what they imagine you might be feeling - and while you wait, feel free to use Inner Thoughts to reflect on what this process is bringing up for you.

**[2026-01-15 03:36:04] AI:**
Shantam hasn't seen your empathy statement yet because the reconciler suggested they share more. This is what they shared:

---
Look Darryl, I'm honestly confused about why we're having this conversation. From my perspective, our project is going really well - we're building the app quickly and making good progress on iterations. I haven't experienced any problems working with you.
*2026-01-15 03:36:04*
---

**[2026-01-15 03:36:04] AI:**
How does this land for you? Take a moment to reflect on what Shantam shared. Does this give you any new insight into what they might be experiencing?

---
It's not just about work revisions - I feel deep down like I'm fundamentally unlovable, no matter how hard I try. I feel too sensitive and vulnerable to even talk about these feelings with others most of the time.

Thank you for sharing that with Shantam. They'll have the chance to refine their understanding of what you're going through.

Let's continue exploring Shantam's perspective. What do you imagine might be going on for Shantam in all of this?

**[2026-01-15 03:36:50] Darryl:**
What he shared with me hurts to hear. Sounds like I’m crazy

**[2026-01-15 03:37:00] AI:**
I hear how much it hurts to have your experience feel dismissed. When Shantam says everything seems fine, while you're carrying all these deep feelings - that can make you question yourself. But you're not crazy at all. Your feelings are real and valid. Looking at their response again - could it be that Shantam is so focused on the technical progress that they're missing the emotional undercurrents? That when they say 'the project is going well,' they're looking at it through that achievement lens we talked about, rather than seeing the relationship dynamics that are impacting you?

**[2026-01-15 03:38:24] Darryl:**
I mean I guess. I thought you’d talk with him and he’d have some empathy with me.

**[2026-01-15 03:38:38] AI:**
I hear how disappointing this feels. You opened up about something really vulnerable, and Shantam's response seems to miss the emotional depth of what you're sharing. But here's what's interesting - the fact that Shantam sees things so differently actually confirms what we were discovering about them: they're viewing the relationship through that 'everything is working well technically' lens, while you're experiencing the emotional undertones. Neither of you is crazy - you're just tuned into different frequencies. Shantam's response actually gives us a chance to refine our understanding of how they might be experiencing things. Would you like to adjust our empathy statement to reflect this new insight?

💡 SHARE SUGGESTION (to help Shantam understand you better):
Thank you for doing such thoughtful empathy work. I noticed that while Shantam focused on work dynamics, you shared some deeper feelings about self-worth and being 'enough.' If you're open to it, would you be willing to help Shantam understand that core feeling better? No pressure at all - only if it feels right to you.
