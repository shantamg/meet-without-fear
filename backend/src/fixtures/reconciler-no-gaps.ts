I hear you - tension can be really draining. It takes courage to step into this conversation.

Can you tell me more about what's been happening? What does the tension feel like for you?

Strategy: Reflect feelings and validate
</thinking>

Miscommunication can be really frustrating - like you're speaking different languages even though you want the same things.

What do you wish they could understand about how you're feeling?

      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: WITNESSING
Intensity: 5
FeelHeardCheck: N
Strategy: Deep acknowledgment of care beneath stress
</thinking>

That's such an important feeling to name - that underneath the stress and tension, there's real care. Sometimes that gets lost in the day-to-day.

It sounds like you want them to see the love that's still there, even when things are hard.

Mode: WITNESSING
Intensity: 6
FeelHeardCheck: Y
Strategy: Reflect deep understanding and check in
</thinking>

You're longing to reconnect - to get back to that sense of being a team. The care is there, and you want both of you to feel it again.

Before we continue, I want to check in with you: Do you feel like I understand what you've been going through?

Strategy: Acknowledge and begin transitioning to empathy building
</thinking>

I'm glad you feel understood. That's an important foundation.

Now that we've explored your experience, I'd like to help you consider Shantam's perspective too. This isn't about excusing anything - it's about understanding. Sometimes when we can see where someone else is coming from, it opens new possibilities.

What do you think might be going on for Shantam?

      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: EMPATHY_BUILDING
Intensity: 4
FeelHeardCheck: N
Strategy: Encourage deeper exploration of partner's perspective
</thinking>

That's a good starting point - recognizing that frustration might be going both ways.

Can you imagine what specifically might be frustrating for Shantam? What might they be experiencing in this situation?

    // Response 6: Deeper empathy building with ReadyShare: Y and draft
    {
      user: 'Maybe they feel like I pull away when stressed and they want to connect',
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: EMPATHY_BUILDING
Intensity: 5
FeelHeardCheck: N
ReadyShare: Y
Strategy: Affirm empathy attempt and offer statement to share
</thinking>

That's a really insightful observation. You're seeing that Shantam might interpret your stress as distance, when really you're just overwhelmed. That awareness shows real empathy.

I've put together a statement that captures what you've been working on understanding:

<draft>
I realize that when I get stressed and pull away, it might feel like I'm pushing you away. That's not my intention at all - I still care deeply, even when I'm overwhelmed. I want us to find ways to stay connected even during stressful times.
</draft>

Does this capture what you'd like to express to them?
