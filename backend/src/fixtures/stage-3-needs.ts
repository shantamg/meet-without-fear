Intensity: 4

Strategy: Acknowledge and encourage sharing
</thinking>

I hear you - tension can be really draining. It takes courage to step into this conversation.

Can you tell me more about what's been happening? What does the tension feel like for you?

    // Response 1: Second witnessing exchange - deeper exploration

      user: "I feel like we've just been miscommunicating",
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: WITNESSING
Intensity: 5
FeelHeardCheck: N
Strategy: Reflect feelings and validate
</thinking>

Miscommunication can be really frustrating - like you're speaking different languages even though you want the same things.

What do you wish they could understand about how you're feeling?

    // Response 2: Third witnessing exchange
    {
      user: "I want them to know I still care, even when I'm stressed",
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: WITNESSING
Intensity: 5
FeelHeardCheck: N
Strategy: Deep acknowledgment of care beneath stress
</thinking>

That's such an important feeling to name - that underneath the stress and tension, there's real care. Sometimes that gets lost in the day-to-day.

It sounds like you want them to see the love that's still there, even when things are hard.

    // Response 3: Feel-heard check trigger
    {
      user: 'Exactly. I just want us to be on the same page again',
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: WITNESSING
Intensity: 6
FeelHeardCheck: Y
Strategy: Reflect deep understanding and check in
</thinking>

You're longing to reconnect - to get back to that sense of being a team. The care is there, and you want both of you to feel it again.

Before we continue, I want to check in with you: Do you feel like I understand what you've been going through?

    // Response 4: Post-feel-heard, transition to empathy building
    {
      user: 'Yes, I feel understood',
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: TRANSITION
Intensity: 4
FeelHeardCheck: N
Strategy: Acknowledge and begin transitioning to empathy building
</thinking>

I'm glad you feel understood. That's an important foundation.

Now that we've explored your experience, I'd like to help you consider your partner's perspective too. This isn't about excusing anything - it's about understanding. Sometimes when we can see where someone else is coming from, it opens new possibilities.

What do you think might be going on for them?

    },

    // Response 5: Building empathy - first attempt
    {
      user: 'I think they might be feeling frustrated too',
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: EMPATHY_BUILDING
Intensity: 4
FeelHeardCheck: N
Strategy: Encourage deeper exploration of partner's perspective
</thinking>

That's a good starting point - recognizing that frustration might be going both ways.

Can you imagine what specifically might be frustrating for them? What might they be experiencing in this situation?
`,
    },

    // Response 6: Deeper empathy building with ReadyShare: Y and draft
    {
      user: 'Maybe they feel like I pull away when stressed and they want to connect',
      ai: `<thinking>
Mode: EMPATHY_BUILDING
Intensity: 5
FeelHeardCheck: N
ReadyShare: Y
Strategy: Affirm empathy attempt and offer statement to share
</thinking>

That's a really insightful observation. You're seeing that your partner might interpret your stress as distance, when really you're just overwhelmed. That awareness shows real empathy.

I've put together a statement that captures what you've been working on understanding:

<draft>
I realize that when I get stressed and pull away, it might feel like I'm pushing you away. That's not my intention at all - I still care deeply, even when I'm overwhelmed. I want us to find ways to stay connected even during stressful times.
</draft>

Does this capture what you'd like to express to them?
