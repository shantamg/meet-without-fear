I hear you - tension can be really draining. It takes courage to step into this conversation.

Can you tell me more about what's been happening? What does the tension feel like for you?

That sounds really hard - feeling unseen while carrying a lot. It's a lonely place to be in a relationship.

What do you wish they could understand about what you're going through?

That exhaustion you're describing - carrying the weight of work and then coming home to more - it sounds overwhelming. You're running on empty and still trying to show up.

That's a lot to hold. How long have you been feeling this way?

Strategy: Reflect deep understanding and check in
</thinking>

Months of feeling depleted and unheard - that's a heavy burden. You've been carrying this alone, wanting desperately to connect but not knowing how to bridge the gap.

Before we continue, I want to check in with you: Do you feel like I understand what you've been going through?
