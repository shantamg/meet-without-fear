/**
 * Empathy Reply Classifier
 *
 * Classifies a user's free-text reply to an empathy attempt into one of
 * three intents: accept, revise, or decline. Used by the Stage 2B flow over
 * Slack where we can't offer Block Kit buttons in long-idle async sessions.
 *
 * Why Haiku over a regex/keyword heuristic:
 * - Humans rarely pick cleanly. "Acceptable, but I really want to emphasize
 *   that I was also scared" should classify as `revise` with the qualifier
 *   captured as the `correction` payload, not as `accept` because the first
 *   word was "Acceptable".
 * - "That's not how I'd put it — try again?" is `revise` but contains no
 *   keyword; "Close, but actually I was more disappointed than angry" is
 *   `revise` with a very specific correction hint.
 * - Haiku adds ~200–300ms on top of the existing turn — negligible
 *   against the Sonnet call (3–8s) that follows.
 *
 * Why not Block Kit buttons:
 * - Async long-running sessions + button expiry = race conditions when a
 *   user clicks an old button after the state has already moved on.
 * - Clicks-that-lose-nuance: users naturally want to qualify their accept
 *   with "yes, but…" which pure buttons throw away.

  const systemPrompt = `You classify a user's reply to an empathy attempt their partner made about their experience.

Three intents are possible:
- "accept": The user confirms the empathy lands. "Yes exactly", "that captures it", "you get it" — even with caveats that DON'T change the core understanding (e.g. "yeah, mostly").
- "revise": The user agrees in part but wants the empathy adjusted. "Close, but…", "not quite — I was more disappointed than angry", "acceptable, but I want to emphasize X". Captures any qualifier/correction as the \`correction\` field.
- "decline": The user rejects the attempt outright. "No, that's not it at all", "way off", "I don't feel understood".

When intent === "revise", extract the CORRECTION the user wants as a clean plain-text phrase (strip "close, but" / "not quite" / etc.). When the user just says "revise" or "try again" with no specifics, set \`correction\` to null.

When intent === "accept" or "decline", set \`correction\` to null.

Output strict JSON:
{
  "intent": "accept" | "revise" | "decline",
  "correction": string | null
