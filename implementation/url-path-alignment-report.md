# URL Path Alignment Report

**Generated:** 2025-12-28
**Worker Agent:** URL Path Alignment Specialist
**Mission:** Fix 3 URL path mismatches between mobile and backend

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully aligned 3 URL path mismatches between mobile hooks and backend routes. All changes made to mobile side to match backend's RESTful conventions and maintain consistency with existing endpoint patterns.

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Modified:** 2
**Type Safety:** VERIFIED (all type checks pass)

---

## URL Path Fixes

### 1. Exercise Completion Endpoint

**Path Mismatch:**
- **Mobile (OLD):** `POST /sessions/:id/exercises`
- **Backend:** `POST /sessions/:id/exercises/complete`

**Resolution:**
- **Mobile (NEW):** `POST /sessions/:id/exercises/complete`
- **File:** `/Users/shantam/Software/be-heard/mobile/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`
- **Line:** 285

**Rationale:**
- Backend path is more explicit and follows RESTful action pattern
- "complete" verb clearly indicates the action being performed
- Prevents ambiguity (POST /exercises could be creating an exercise vs completing one)
- Consistent with other backend routes that use action verbs (sign, confirm, validate, etc.)

**Decision:** Update mobile to match backend

---

### 2. Compact Status Endpoint

**Path Mismatch:**
- **Mobile (OLD):** `GET /sessions/:id/compact`
- **Backend:** `GET /sessions/:id/compact/status`

**Resolution:**
- **Mobile (NEW):** `GET /sessions/:id/compact/status`
- **File:** `/Users/shantam/Software/be-heard/mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts`
- **Line:** 142

**Rationale:**
- Backend follows resource/action pattern consistently
- "status" clarifies it's a GET operation for status, not a general compact resource
- Prevents route collision (if later we add POST /compact/sign, GET /compact vs GET /compact/status is clearer)
- Matches backend's architectural pattern for other status endpoints

**Decision:** Update mobile to match backend

---

### 3. Strategy Overlap/Reveal Endpoint

**Path Mismatch:**
- **Mobile (OLD):** `GET /sessions/:id/strategies/reveal`
- **Backend:** `GET /sessions/:id/strategies/overlap`

**Resolution:**
- **Mobile (NEW):** `GET /sessions/:id/strategies/overlap`
- **File:** `/Users/shantam/Software/be-heard/mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts`
- **Line:** 675

**Rationale:**
- "overlap" is more descriptive of the actual business logic (finding overlapping rankings between partners)
- Backend naming is more aligned with domain language
- "reveal" is vague and could mean revealing strategies, rankings, or overlap
- Shared DTOs already use "RevealOverlapResponse" which indicates overlap is the correct term
- Consistency with backend improves API discoverability

**Decision:** Update mobile to match backend

---

## Alignment Methodology

All three decisions follow the same pattern:

1. **Backend is source of truth** - Backend routes define the API contract
2. **RESTful conventions** - Backend follows RESTful patterns more consistently
3. **Least breaking changes** - Mobile is easier to change (single codebase vs API versioning)
4. **Domain language alignment** - Backend names are more descriptive and domain-specific

---

## Pre-existing Consistency Pattern

After analysis, the decision to update mobile in all 3 cases follows the existing pattern in the codebase:

- Backend defines explicit, verbose routes (e.g., `/empathy/draft`, `/empathy/consent`, `/needs/confirm`)
- Mobile consumes these routes exactly as defined
- Shared DTOs provide type safety for request/response contracts

This alignment ensures:
- API is self-documenting
- No ambiguity in endpoint purpose
- Future developers can easily understand the API surface

---

## Verification

### Type Checking
```bash
npm run check
```
**Result:** PASS - All TypeScript type checks pass across all workspaces

### DTO Alignment
All three endpoints still use correct shared DTOs:

1. **Exercise Completion**
   - Request: `CompleteExerciseRequest`
   - Response: `CompleteExerciseResponse`
   - Status: ALIGNED

2. **Compact Status**
   - Response: `CompactStatusResponse`
   - Status: ALIGNED

3. **Strategy Overlap**
   - Response: `RevealOverlapResponse`
   - Status: ALIGNED

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/mobile/src/hooks/useMessages.ts`
- **Function:** `useCompleteExercise()`
- **Line 285:** Changed URL from `/exercises` to `/exercises/complete`
- **Impact:** Exercise completion API calls now match backend route

### 2. `/mobile/src/hooks/useStages.ts`
- **Function:** `useCompactStatus()`
- **Line 142:** Changed URL from `/compact` to `/compact/status`
- **Function:** `useStrategiesReveal()`
- **Line 675:** Changed URL from `/strategies/reveal` to `/strategies/overlap`
- **Impact:** Stage 0 and Stage 4 API calls now match backend routes

---

## Additional Type Cleanup (Auto-applied)

During the fix process, a linter automatically cleaned up type naming in `useStages.ts`:

**Before:**
- `SignCompactResponseInput`
- `CompactStatusResponseInput`
- `FeelHeardResponseInput`
- `GetProgressResponseInput`
- etc.

**After:**
- `SignCompactResponse`
- `CompactStatusResponse`
- `ConfirmFeelHeardResponse`
- `GetProgressResponse`
- etc.

**Note:** The "Input" suffix was removed to match the actual shared DTO exports. This is a separate type naming issue documented in the cross-reference report (section 4.2 - Type Mismatches).

---

## Backend Routes Reference

For reference, here are the correct backend routes:

### Stage 0: Compact
- `POST /sessions/:sessionId/compact/sign`
- `GET /sessions/:sessionId/compact/status`

### Emotions & Exercises
- `POST /sessions/:id/emotions`
- `GET /sessions/:id/emotions`
- `POST /sessions/:id/exercises/complete`

### Stage 4: Strategies
- `GET /sessions/:id/strategies`
- `POST /sessions/:id/strategies`
- `POST /sessions/:id/strategies/rank`
- `GET /sessions/:id/strategies/overlap`

---

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
**NONE** - These changes only affect mobile's internal API client. The backend routes were already correct.

### Migration Needed
**NONE** - No data migration required. Mobile app will simply call the correct endpoints on next build.

### Backward Compatibility
- Mobile changes are forward-compatible (will work with current backend)
- Backend routes remain unchanged (no API version bump needed)

---

## Testing Recommendations

While type checking passes, recommend manual testing of the following user flows:

1. **Exercise Completion Flow** (Stage 1)
   - User records emotional reading
   - User completes breathing/body scan exercise
   - Verify exercise completion is logged

2. **Compact Signing Flow** (Stage 0)
   - User views compact
   - User signs compact
   - Verify compact status shows both partners' signatures

3. **Strategy Ranking Flow** (Stage 4)
   - Both users propose strategies
   - Both users rank strategies
   - Verify overlap reveal shows matching strategies

---

## Remaining URL Mismatches

**NONE** - All URL path mismatches identified in the cross-reference report have been resolved.

The cross-reference report identified 10 missing backend endpoints (dead mobile API calls), but those are a separate issue from URL mismatches. Those endpoints need to be either:
1. Implemented on backend, or
2. Removed from mobile (if no longer needed)

See cross-reference report section 4.1 for the full list of dead mobile API calls.

---

## Conclusion

All 3 URL path mismatches have been successfully resolved by updating mobile hooks to match backend routes. This approach:

- Maintains backend as the source of truth for API contracts
- Follows RESTful conventions consistently
- Improves API discoverability and self-documentation
- Requires minimal changes (mobile only)
- Preserves type safety through shared DTOs

The system is now more aligned, with mobile consuming backend routes exactly as defined.
